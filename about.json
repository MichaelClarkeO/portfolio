    "bio": "I am a hardworker whose resilience is geared to productive results. These past few months I’ve dedicated myself and my time to becoming a software engineer and increasing my ability to think like a software engineer. I’m highly motivated to get the opportunity to learn from others as well as share the knowledge that I have gained. My ability to consistently be reliable would be an asset to any company. My personal growth is very important to me. I have gained a ton of character and humility from my previous experiences. A few of my biggest interests at the moment are traveling, gaining skills/knowledge, and networking and interacting with others."
